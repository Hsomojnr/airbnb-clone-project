# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview

This project is a clone of the AirBnB web application. The goal is to understand and build a simplified version of the AirBnB platform, including features such as user registration, listing creation, booking functionality, and a review system.

## Project Goals

- Learn and implement full-stack web development.
- Build and deploy a dynamic web application.
- Work with backend APIs, databases, and frontend frameworks.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Django)
- **Database**:  PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Deployment**: Heroku, Render, or AWS

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend and RESTful APIs. It handles routing, business logic, authentication, and server-side rendering.

### 2. PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database used to store structured data such as users, bookings, listings, and reviews. Chosen for its reliability, scalability, and support for advanced querying.

### 3. HTML/CSS
The fundamental technologies for building and styling the structure of web pages. HTML provides the content structure, while CSS handles layout and visual design.

### 4. JavaScript
Adds interactivity to the frontend, enabling dynamic content updates, client-side validations, and improved user experience.

### 5. GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides more flexibility than REST and can optimize data fetching.

### 6. Git
A version control system to track changes in source code and collaborate with team members effectively.

### 7. GitHub
A cloud-based platform to host the Git repository, manage code reviews, track issues, and collaborate in a team setting.

### 8. Docker
Used to containerize the application, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy in consistent environments.

### 9. CI/CD Tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
Automate testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure fast and reliable software delivery.

### 10. Deployment Platforms (Heroku, AWS, Render)
Used to host the live version of the application for end-users. Handles scalability, performance, and availability.



## Team Roles

The success of this project depends on collaboration between several roles, each contributing specific skills and responsibilities.

### 3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the project‚Äôs database schema. Ensures data consistency, performance optimization, and backup strategies for secure data storage.

### 4. DevOps Engineer
Manages code deployment, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure, and monitoring tools. Ensures smooth development-to-production transitions and uptime.

### 5. UX/UI Designer
Designs the visual look and feel of the platform, ensuring intuitive interfaces and positive user experience. Provides wireframes and mockups for frontend developers.

### 6. Project Manager
Coordinates the team, sets milestones, and ensures the project stays on schedule. Facilitates communication, task tracking, and risk management.

### 7. QA Engineer
Responsible for testing the application to ensure it works as expected. Writes test cases, performs manual and automated testing, and reports bugs.

- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `rating` (1‚Äì5)
- `comment`

**Relationship:**

- A **property** can have **many reviews**

### 5. Payments

Represents payment records for completed bookings.

**Fields:**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `payment_date`
- `payment_status` (paid, failed, refunded)

**Relationship:**
- Each **booking** has **one payment**

## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the application.

### 1. User Management

Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication and authorization ensure secure access, allowing users to act as guests or hosts depending on their role.

### 2. Property Management

Allows hosts to list new properties by providing descriptions, pricing, photos, and location. Hosts can edit or delete their listings, which will be displayed to potential guests.

### 3. Booking System

Enables guests to view property availability and make bookings for selected dates. The system checks for conflicts, calculates the total price, and records the reservation.

### 4. Payment Integration

Processes payments for confirmed bookings through a secure gateway. Tracks payment status and ensures that each booking has an associated transaction.

### 5. Reviews and Ratings

Allows guests to leave ratings and reviews after completing a stay. This feature builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 6. Search and Filter

Guests can search for listings by location, price, availability, and other filters. This improves user experience by helping users find the most relevant properties quickly.

### 7. Admin Panel

An administrative interface to monitor users, listings, and bookings. Useful for moderation, analytics, and managing platform integrity.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is a critical part of this project to protect user data, ensure data integrity, and prevent malicious activities. Below are the key security measures we plan to implement:

### 1. Authentication

Only registered users will be able to access certain parts of the application. We'll use secure authentication methods (e.g., token-based authentication with JWT) to verify user identities and manage sessions.

üîê **Why it matters:** Ensures that only verified users can log in, interact with data, and make bookings or payments.

### 2. Authorization

After authentication, users will only be allowed to perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., hosts can only edit their own listings). Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to enforce this.

üîê **Why it matters:** Prevents unauthorized access to resources, such as editing someone else‚Äôs property or viewing another user‚Äôs bookings.

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

All input from users will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

üîê **Why it matters:** Protects the system from malicious user input that could corrupt or leak data.

### 4. Rate Limiting

Limits the number of API requests a user can make within a certain time frame. This helps to prevent brute force attacks and abuse of endpoints.

üîê **Why it matters:** Ensures fair usage and protects the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

### 5. Secure Data Transmission

All data will be transmitted over HTTPS to prevent data from being intercepted in transit.

üîê **Why it matters:** Protects sensitive information like login credentials and payment details from being stolen during transmission.

### 6. Logging & Monitoring

All critical actions and errors will be logged and monitored to detect suspicious behavior or breaches.

üîê **Why it matters:** Helps in identifying and responding to security incidents promptly.


## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a modern software development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It ensures that changes are integrated frequently and delivered reliably to production or staging environments.

### Why CI/CD is Important

- **Faster Development**: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
- **Higher Code Quality**: Automatically runs tests and checks before changes are merged or deployed.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Continuous testing helps catch issues early in the development lifecycle.
- **Reliable Deployment**: Ensures that code changes are consistently and correctly deployed, reducing manual errors.

### Tools for CI/CD

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows directly from the GitHub repository. Useful for running tests, building containers, and deploying on push.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure it runs consistently across all environments.
- **Jenkins**: A flexible open-source automation server that can orchestrate complex CI/CD workflows.
- **Heroku/GitHub Pages/AWS**: Can be integrated into the pipeline to automatically deploy the app after tests pass.
